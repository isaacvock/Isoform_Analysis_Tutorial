# Welcome to the EZbakR-suite isoform analysis tutorial
This repo hosts data for a full tutorial on how to use the EZbakR-suite to analyze the degradation and synthesis kinetics of individual transcript isoforms using NR-seq data from total RNA.

The documentation walking you through the full analysis is here: https://isaacvock.github.io/Isoform_Tutorial_Docs/
